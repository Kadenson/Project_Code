        <h2>Brooklyn</h2>
        <p>The bridge to the city of dreams. A 1.1 mile long bridge that crosses the east river between brooklyn and manhattan. It takes about a hour or so to walk across
            but is especially spectacular to walk across during night. Walking over while the skyline is in full view really highlights the city and all its awesomeness.
            The brooklyn bridge is one of the hotspots that most tourist will visit so expect it have a heavy flow of traffic in the form of pedestrians but also vehicles.
